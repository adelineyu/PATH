# PATH
This project was intented to show users various transit options. Based on cost, time, and distance, the website would tell users which was the most efficient based on their preferences and our calculations. It would do this by drawing on various APIs- for gas prices, Uber prices, public transit costs, and walking and driving times. 

Unfortunately, we were unable to create a version of this app that works well. While most of our individual parts work correctly, pulling them all together was too difficult. We plan to continue to work on this app and make a usable and helpful version of the website sometime in the future.
